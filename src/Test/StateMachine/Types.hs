-- | An untyped action is an action where the response type is hidden
--   away using an existential type.
--
--   We need to hide the response type when generating actions, because
--   in general the actions we want to generate will have different
--   response types; and thus we can only type the generating function
--   if we hide the response type.
data Untyped (act :: (* -> *) -> * -> *) where
  Untyped :: (Show resp, Typeable resp) => act Symbolic resp -> Untyped act

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | When generating actions we have access to a model containing
--   symbolic references.
type Generator model act = model Symbolic -> Gen (Untyped act)

-- | Shrinking should preserve the response type of the action.
type Shrinker act = forall (v :: * -> *) resp.
  act v resp -> [act v resp]

-- | Pre-conditions are checked while generating, at this stage we do
--   not yet have access to concrete references.
type Precondition model act = forall resp.
  model Symbolic -> act Symbolic resp -> Bool

-- | The transition function must be polymorphic in the type of
--   variables used, as it is used both while generating and executing.
type Transition model act = forall resp v. Ord1 v =>
  model v -> act v resp -> v resp -> model v

-- | Post-conditions are checked after the actions have been executed
--   and we got a response.
type Postcondition model act = forall resp.
  model Concrete -> act Concrete resp -> resp -> Property

-- | The initial model is polymorphic in the type of references it uses,
--   so that it can be used both in the pre- and the post-condition
--   check.
type InitialModel m = forall (v :: * -> *). m v

-- | When we execute our actions we have access to concrete references.
type Semantics act m = forall resp. act Concrete resp -> m resp

-- | How to run the monad used by the semantics.
type Runner m = m Property -> IO Property
